    <h4>about</h4>
    <p>
      Synthetic Surfaces is an imitation e-commerce website that uses the structure of the online store to serve as a catalog of images. Modeled as a market, this site becomes a space of consumption and exchange as well as a process in which commodity value is questioned. The product images are the “products” themselves—in this economy there is no separation between the abstract and the physical, the representation and the real.
      <br><br>
      Using Anne Anlin Cheng’s book Ornamentalism as a conceptual foundation and Google Translate as a tool constituting the Western gaze, I curated a final selection of 30 “products”, six in each product category, that highlight the construction of Asiatic identity in Western culture. A combination of critical race and gender theory, Ornamentalism theorizes the link between the Asian woman and the Eastern aesthetic commodity—tracing a history of material-aesthetic production to examine personhood rendered into objecthood. The yellow body is gendered feminine, it is fragile, its value lies in surface aesthetics, it is ornamental to excess. In turn, the personhood of the West is reinforced as biological, masculine, rational, and modern.
      <br><br>
      The final curated selection of screenshots is loaded with symbolic meaning, with “translations" carrying connotations of constructed Eastern personhood through the Western gaze: the synthetic (“machine people”, “plastic”), aggregated (“silicon people”), feminine (“women”, “female”, “young girl”, “butterfly"), fragile (“break”), and non-European (“lotus vice”). 
      <br><br>
      The “synthetic surface”, then, is three-fold: the first being the physical ornamental surface of Chinese commodities, the second being the rendering of the yellow body and flesh into aesthetic surface, and the third being the manufactured image distorted with Google Translate’s superimposed text.

    <p>
      Interested in race relations, commerce, and global movements of bodies and things under Western imperialism, I looked at images of historical Asiatic commodity exports with Google Translate’s Instant Translation feature. Because the surfaces of porcelain, textiles, jade, and silk are heavily ornate and appear to consist of dense clusters of shapes and lines, they become ripe ground for this translation technology to mine for Chinese characters, which are logogrammatic in nature and designed from a system of linear strokes. In attempt to find and then “translate” Chinese where there is actually no text, the program generates meaning from pure image, representative of the way the West has historically constructed the idea of the East. Identity is superimposed and manufactured onto the body of the Other.
      <br><br>

      Digital and intangible in nature, screenshots are two-dimensional artifacts that carry value that is symbolic rather than material. We consume images instantaneously and constantly, often without intention, purpose, and without material exchange at all. So what is exchanged in the image economy? How do we assign images value, and how does the intentional and hyper-aware consumption of images affect their value? Do they gain power the more you look at them—in time exchanged?
